## About

I'm a second semester college student learning Java. This repository tracks my progress as I practice array manipulation, algorithms, and problem-solving.

## Learning Journey

This repo shows my practice work from various sources as I build my programming skills. Not everything is perfect, but that's the point - it's all about learning!
